                Great! You’re speed reading this text. Most people read around 240 words per minute, but you’re reading 350 words per minute right now. Already ~1.5x faster than average. And this isn’t the limit. When you feel comfortable, use the speed slider to go even faster.

              <p>
                The method you’re using is Rapid Serial Visual Presentation, in short RSVP. It shows one word or a short phrase at a time in the same spot on the screen so you can read without moving your eyes and scrolling the page. That lets you read much faster with no training.
              </p>
              <p>
                For most of the people this intro would take ~55 seconds, but you finished it in ~38 seconds. You can read any web page like this: select any text and “<span data-app-name></span>” is always right-click away.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now, close this window to return to the onboarding page and learn other ways to use “<span data-app-name></span>”.

            Eye care tip: RSVP keeps your gaze fixed, so remember the general eye care advice. Blink often, sit with good posture, adjust screen brightness, and take regular breaks to keep your eyes comfortable.

                You’re already reading ~1.5x faster than average human. But wait, why the extension is called “<span data-app-name></span>” then?

                To help you finish pages even faster, we combine RSVP with AI pre-processing:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. <strong>AI summarization.</strong> Many web pages are filled with unnecessary text that just wastes your time. For example, before you finally learn how to cook rice, you might need to scroll through a long story about its history and cultural importance. “<span data-app-name></span>” solves this by pre-processing text with AI to keep only the essential information. You can choose how much summarization you want — from none to keep every detail to strong summarization for just the core meaning.
                This feature alone can help you finish pages up to 3x faster by reducing the amount of content you need to read.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. <strong>AI translation.</strong> Even if you know several languages, your native language is still your reading superpower — you process it faster and with less effort.
                “<span data-app-name></span>” uses AI translation to tap into that advantage by instantly converting any content into your native language, so you can read more comfortably and quickly.
                The exact speed boost depends on your language skills, but here is an example from me: I read English pretty well and use it a lot, yet reading in my native language is still about 1.6x faster for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. <strong>AI highlighting.</strong> Our AI automatically highlights key words and phrases, showing them slightly longer during reading so your brain naturally focuses on what matters most.
              </p>
              <p>
                My personal boost calculation:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. ~2x from RSVP
              </p>
              <p>
                2. ~3x from summarization
              </p>
              <p>
                3. ~1.6x from translation
              </p>
              <p>
                Which multiplies into ~10x overall. Your exact numbers may differ, but for me, it adds up to hours saved every month.
