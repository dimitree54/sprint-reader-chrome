# Sprint Reader - Advanced Reading Algorithm

_Last updated: January 2025_

## Overview

Sprint Reader uses an advanced **Word Frequency + Shannon Entropy Algorithm** that adapts the display time for each word based on its complexity, frequency of use, and reading context. This creates a more natural reading rhythm where simple words flash quickly and complex words give you more time to process.

## üéØ Core Timing Algorithm

### Base Timing Calculation

Every word starts with a **base duration** calculated from your WPM setting:
```
Base Time = 60,000 √∑ WPM (in milliseconds)
```

**Examples at different WPM settings:**
- 300 WPM: 200ms base time
- 400 WPM: 150ms base time
- 600 WPM: 100ms base time
- 1000 WPM: 60ms base time

### Word Frequency Multipliers

The algorithm then adjusts this base time based on how common the word is in English:

| Word Frequency | Examples | Time Multiplier | Rationale |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Very Common** (1M+ uses) | the, and, is, you, that, it, he, was, for, on | **√ó0.7** (-30%) | Your brain processes these instantly |
| **Common** (100K+ uses) | about, after, again, against, back, because | **√ó0.85** (-15%) | Familiar words need less time |
| **Regular** (10K+ uses) | important, example, different, following | **√ó1.0** (normal) | Standard processing time |
| **Uncommon** (1K+ uses) | algorithm, architecture, implementation | **√ó1.2** (+20%) | Technical terms need more time |
| **Rare** (<1K uses) | supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, antidisestablishmentarianism | **√ó1.5** (+50%) | Complex/unknown words |

### Shannon Entropy Adjustment

The algorithm also considers the **information complexity** of each word using Shannon entropy:

- **Simple patterns**: "that", "when", "with" ‚Üí minimal adjustment
- **Complex patterns**: "rhythm", "psychology", "strength" ‚Üí +10-30% time
- **Very complex**: technical terms, foreign words ‚Üí up to +30% time

## üìä Real Timing Examples

Here are actual timing examples at **400 WPM** (150ms base):

### Common Words (Fast)
| Word | Category | Final Time | Calculation |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| "I" | Very common | **105ms** | 150ms √ó 0.7 = 105ms |
| "the" | Very common | **105ms** | 150ms √ó 0.7 = 105ms |
| "and" | Very common | **105ms** | 150ms √ó 0.7 = 105ms |
| "you" | Very common | **105ms** | 150ms √ó 0.7 = 105ms |
| "have" | Common | **128ms** | 150ms √ó 0.85 = 128ms |
| "about" | Common | **128ms** | 150ms √ó 0.85 = 128ms |

### Regular Words (Normal)
| Word | Category | Final Time | Calculation |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| "reading" | Regular | **150ms** | 150ms √ó 1.0 = 150ms |
| "example" | Regular | **150ms** | 150ms √ó 1.0 = 150ms |
| "different" | Regular | **150ms** | 150ms √ó 1.0 = 150ms |

### Complex Words (Slow)
| Word | Category | Final Time | Calculation |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| "algorithm" | Uncommon | **180ms** | 150ms √ó 1.2 = 180ms |
| "implementation" | Uncommon | **195ms** | 150ms √ó (1.2 + 0.1 entropy) = 195ms |
| "antidisestablishmentarianism" | Rare | **270ms** | 150ms √ó (1.5 + 0.3 entropy) = 270ms |
| "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" | Rare | **315ms** | 150ms √ó (1.5 + 0.6 entropy) = 315ms |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Punctuation Pauses

Additional pauses are added after punctuation marks:

### Pause Multipliers
- **Comma, semicolon, colon** (`,`, `;`, `:`): **+50% of base time**
- **Period, exclamation, question** (`.`, `!`, `?`): **+100% of base time**
- **Paragraph break** (`\n\n`): **+250% of base time**

### Punctuation Examples (400 WPM base = 150ms)
| Text | Word Time | Pause Time | Total Time | Explanation |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| "word," | 150ms | **+75ms** | **225ms** | 150ms √ó 0.5 = 75ms pause |
| "end!" | 105ms | **+150ms** | **255ms** | 150ms √ó 1.0 = 150ms pause |
| "sentence." | 128ms | **+150ms** | **278ms** | 150ms √ó 1.0 = 150ms pause |
| [paragraph] | varies | **+375ms** | +375ms | 150ms √ó 2.5 = 375ms pause |

## üéØ Optimal Letter Centering

### The Science Behind Letter Positioning

Sprint Reader doesn't just center words‚Äîit centers the **optimal letter** within each word that your eye should focus on. This is based on reading research showing that the eye naturally fixates on specific positions within words.

### Optimal Letter Position Rules

The algorithm calculates which letter to highlight based on word length:

| Word Length | Optimal Letter Position | Examples |
|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| **1 character** | Position 1 | "I" ‚Üí **I** |
| **2-4 characters** | Position 2 | "the" ‚Üí t**h**e, "word" ‚Üí w**o**rd |
| **5-9 characters** | Position 3 | "reading" ‚Üí re**a**ding, "example" ‚Üí ex**a**mple |
| **10+ characters** | Position 4 | "implementation" ‚Üí imp**l**ementation |

### Visual Centering Process

1. **Letter Wrapping**: Each word is split into individual `<span>` elements:
   ```html
   "reading" becomes:
   <span class="char1">r</span><span class="char2">e</span><span class="char3">a</span>...
   ```

2. **Optimal Letter Highlighting**: The calculated optimal letter gets orange color (`#FF8C00`):
   ```
   "reading" ‚Üí re[a]ding  (where [a] is highlighted in orange)
   ```

3. **Precise Centering**: The entire word is positioned so the highlighted letter sits exactly in the center of the viewport:
   ```
   Viewport center: 50% of screen width
   Word position: calculated so optimal letter center = viewport center
   ```

### Centering Examples

| Word | Optimal Letter | Visual Result |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| "I" | Position 1 | **[I]** ‚Üê centered |
| "the" | Position 2 | t**[h]**e ‚Üê h is centered |
| "reading" | Position 3 | re**[a]**ding ‚Üê a is centered |
| "implementation" | Position 4 | imp**[l]**ementation ‚Üê l is centered |

## üî¨ Why This Algorithm Works

### Reading Research Foundation

1. **Fixation Points**: Research shows readers naturally fixate on specific positions in words, not the beginning or center
2. **Word Recognition**: High-frequency words are processed faster by the brain
3. **Information Theory**: Complex letter patterns (high entropy) require more processing time
4. **Punctuation Processing**: Natural reading includes pauses after punctuation for comprehension

### Adaptive Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Common words don't slow you down
- **Comprehension**: Complex words get adequate processing time
- **Natural Rhythm**: Mirrors natural reading patterns with punctuation pauses
- **Eye Strain Reduction**: Consistent focal point reduces eye movement
- **Speed Scaling**: Everything scales proportionally with your WPM setting

## üìà Performance Scaling

The algorithm scales beautifully across all reading speeds:

### Speed Comparison Examples

| Word Type | 200 WPM | 400 WPM | 800 WPM | 1200 WPM |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| "the" (common) | 210ms | 105ms | 53ms | 35ms |
| "reading" (regular) | 300ms | 150ms | 75ms | 50ms |
| "algorithm" (complex) | 360ms | 180ms | 90ms | 60ms |
| Comma pause | +150ms | +75ms | +38ms | +25ms |
| Period pause | +300ms | +150ms | +75ms | +50ms |

This ensures that regardless of your reading speed, the **relative timing relationships** between different word types remain optimal for comprehension.
