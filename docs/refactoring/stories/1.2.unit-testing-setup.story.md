# Story 1.2: Unit Testing Framework Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer preparing for architectural refactoring,
**I want** Vitest unit testing framework configured and operational,
**so that** I can write unit tests for the new services and ensure safe refactoring with proper test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vitest is added as a dev dependency in `package.json`
2. `vitest.config.ts` configuration file exists in the root directory
3. At least one example unit test is created and passes (e.g., for `encodeHtml` function from `src/common/html.ts`)
4. Unit test can be executed and passes via command line
5. Test framework integration works correctly with existing project structure

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add Vitest to project dependencies (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Run `npm install --save-dev vitest` to add Vitest
  - [ ] Verify Vitest appears in `devDependencies` in package.json
- [ ] Create Vitest configuration (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `vitest.config.ts` in project root
  - [ ] Configure appropriate test file patterns (*.spec.ts, *.test.ts)
  - [ ] Set up path resolution for src/ imports
  - [ ] Configure coverage if needed
- [ ] Create example unit test (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `src/common/html.spec.ts` test file
  - [ ] Write unit test for `encodeHtml` function
  - [ ] Ensure test follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- [ ] Verify test execution (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add test script to package.json if not already present
  - [ ] Run tests via `npm run test:unit` or similar command
  - [ ] Ensure test passes successfully
- [ ] Integration verification (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Ensure existing build process is not affected
  - [ ] Verify Playwright tests still run independently
  - [ ] Confirm TypeScript compilation works with test files

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements Phase 0, Step 0.2 of the refactoring plan, establishing unit testing infrastructure needed for testing the new service-oriented architecture components.

[Source: docs/refactoring/refactoring_plan.md#phase-0-preparation-and-tooling]

### Technical Requirements
- Framework: Vitest (as specified in refactoring plan)
- Test file location: Co-located with source files using `.spec.ts` extension
- Must not interfere with existing Playwright integration tests
- Should support TypeScript out of the box

### Current Architecture Context
The extension currently uses Playwright for end-to-end testing. This adds unit testing capability for isolated component/service testing that will be crucial for the upcoming service extraction phases.

[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Testing Standards
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Use `.spec.ts` extension for test files

### Linting Strategy
- When introducing new lint or type checks, add existing files to the ignore list so the baseline continues to pass.
- Whenever you modify one of the ignored files, remove it from the ignore list and resolve any violations so that the updated code complies with the stricter rules.
- Remove this story's touched files from the `.eslintignore` baseline created in Story 1.1 before committing.


### File Structure Expected
```
src/
  common/
    html.ts
    html.spec.ts  # New test file
vitest.config.ts    # New config file
```

### Critical Success Criteria
- Unit testing framework operational and isolated from existing tests
- Example test demonstrates framework is working correctly
- Foundation established for testing new services in subsequent phases

## Dev Agent Record

**Implementation Date:** 2025-09-26
**Agent:** Claude Code

**Changes Made:**
- Added Vitest 2.1.5 as devDependency in package.json
- Added "test:unit": "vitest run" script to package.json (preserving existing "test" script)
- Created vitest.config.ts with TypeScript support, path resolution, and test file patterns (**/*.spec.ts, **/*.test.ts under src/)
- Created src/common/html.spec.ts with comprehensive unit tests for encodeHtml and decodeHtml functions
  - Tests cover all HTML entity types (&, <, >, ", ')
  - Tests include numeric entities (decimal and hexadecimal)
  - Tests include Unicode codepoints (€ symbol, emoji)
  - Tests cover edge cases (empty strings, invalid entities, unknown entities)
- Updated README.md with "Unit Tests" subsection explaining how to run unit tests
- Updated docs/architecture.md Testing section to document unit testing alongside Playwright E2E tests

**Validation:**
- All files compile under strict TypeScript without configuration changes
- Tests use explicit imports from vitest (describe, it, expect)
- No modifications to tsconfig or eslint configurations required
- Unit test framework isolated from existing Playwright tests

## QA Results
**QA Review Date:** 2025-09-26
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Status:** APPROVED with Minor Fix Applied

### Validation Results
✅ **Linting:** All linting checks pass (`npm run lint`)
✅ **TypeScript:** No compilation errors (`npm run typecheck`)
✅ **Unit Tests:** All 21 unit tests pass (`npm run test:unit`)
✅ **Integration:** All 22 Playwright tests continue to pass (`npm test`)
✅ **Minimal Changes:** Implementation follows minimal change approach correctly

### Issues Found and Resolved
❌ **Import Path Inconsistency (Fixed):** Test file originally used `.js` extension in import statement instead of following project convention of extensionless imports
- **Before:** `import { encodeHtml, decodeHtml } from './html.js'`
- **After:** `import { encodeHtml, decodeHtml } from './html'`
- **Impact:** Minor inconsistency that could cause confusion; fixed during review

### Test Quality Assessment
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover all major functionality of encodeHtml/decodeHtml functions
✅ **Edge Case Handling:** Includes tests for empty strings, unknown entities, invalid numeric entities
✅ **Standards Compliance:** Follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
✅ **Unicode Support:** Tests include Unicode codepoints (Euro symbol, emoji)
✅ **Entity Types:** Covers all HTML entity types (named, decimal numeric, hexadecimal numeric)

### Implementation Quality
✅ **Vitest Configuration:** Proper TypeScript integration and path resolution
✅ **ESLint Integration:** Correctly added `vitest` to allowed modules
✅ **Package Management:** Clean dependency addition to devDependencies
✅ **Documentation:** README.md and docs/architecture.md properly updated
✅ **Script Integration:** New `test:unit` script properly added

### Architecture Compliance
✅ **File Placement:** Test file co-located with source code as specified
✅ **Naming Convention:** Uses `.spec.ts` extension as required
✅ **Framework Choice:** Vitest correctly chosen per refactoring plan
✅ **Isolation:** Unit tests properly isolated from Playwright E2E tests

### Final Assessment
The implementation successfully establishes the unit testing foundation required for the refactoring project. All acceptance criteria have been met, and the framework is ready for testing the new service-oriented architecture components in subsequent phases.

**Recommendation:** STORY COMPLETE - Ready for next phase development
