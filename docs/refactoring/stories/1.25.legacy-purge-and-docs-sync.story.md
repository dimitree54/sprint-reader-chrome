# Story 1.25: Legacy Purge & Docs Sync

## Status
Done

## Story
As a maintainer finalizing the refactor,
I want to remove all remaining legacy references and sync documentation,
so that the repo is 100% aligned with the target architecture and free of hybrid notes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Legacy files listed in `docs/refactoring/legacy_removal_plan.md` are deleted after their references reach zero.
2. `docs/architecture.md` and `README.md` are updated to reflect renderer-only UI, PlaybackService loop ownership, and store-only state.
3. No documentation mentions hybrid/bridge/coexistence paths.
4. Ripgrep audit shows no references to deleted modules.
5. Lint, typecheck, unit, and Playwright tests all pass on a clean build.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Reference audit and deletions
  - [ ] Confirm zero references to: `render.ts`, `playback.ts`, `controls.ts`, `state/legacy-state-helpers.ts`
  - [ ] Delete files and remove any dead exports/imports
- [ ] Docs and README updates
  - [ ] Update `docs/architecture.md` to remove legacy coexistence notes
  - [ ] Update `README.md` to describe final architecture and flows
  - [ ] Cross-link relevant services and UI modules
- [ ] Verification
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint`
  - [ ] Run `npm run typecheck`
  - [ ] Run `npm test` (ensure OPENAI_API_KEY e2e path is green)
  - [ ] Manual smoke: playback, WPM, theme, streaming progress, background + popup flows

## Dev Notes
### Architecture Context
Executes the Cross-Cutting Tasks and Exit Criteria from `docs/refactoring/legacy_removal_plan.md`.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Doc drift â†’ Keep docs edits in the same PR as code deletions.
