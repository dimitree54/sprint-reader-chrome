# Story 1.4: Create BrowserApiService

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer refactoring the Sprint Reader extension,
**I want** a centralized BrowserApiService that abstracts browser API interactions,
**so that** the codebase becomes more testable and browser API dependencies are isolated in one location.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `BrowserApiService` class is created in `src/core/browser-api.service.ts`
2. Service exposes methods like `sendMessage`, `createWindow`, and other browser API interactions used throughout the extension
3. All logic from `src/platform/browser.ts` and `wrap-chrome.ts` is moved into the service class
4. Service maintains backward compatibility with existing API usage patterns
5. All existing Playwright tests continue to pass
6. Application functionality remains unchanged

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create BrowserApiService class (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `src/core/browser-api.service.ts` file
  - [ ] Define BrowserApiService class with public methods
  - [ ] Implement `sendMessage()` method for runtime messaging
  - [ ] Implement `createWindow()` method for window management
  - [ ] Implement storage access methods (`getStorage`, `setStorage`)
  - [ ] Implement context menu and command methods as needed
- [ ] Migrate existing browser API logic (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Move logic from `src/platform/browser.ts` to the service
  - [ ] Move wrapper helpers from `src/platform/wrap-chrome.ts` to the service
  - [ ] Ensure Chrome/Firefox/Safari compatibility is maintained
  - [ ] Implement singleton pattern or dependency injection pattern
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Verify service API matches existing usage patterns
  - [ ] Provide migration path for existing imports
  - [ ] Ensure no breaking changes to calling code
- [ ] Verification and testing (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Run `npm test` to ensure all Playwright tests pass
  - [ ] Run `npm run build:chrome` to verify build integrity
  - [ ] Test extension manually in browser to verify functionality
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` to ensure code quality

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements Phase 1, Step 1.1 of the refactoring plan, creating the first core service that abstracts browser API dependencies. This is critical for making the rest of the application more testable and preparing for service-oriented architecture.

[Source: docs/refactoring/refactoring_plan.md#phase-1-core-services-abstraction]

### Current Architecture Analysis
The extension currently has browser API access scattered throughout:
- `src/platform/browser.ts` - Main browser API resolver
- `src/platform/wrap-chrome.ts` - Chrome API wrapper helpers
- `src/platform/types.ts` - Platform type definitions

[Source: docs/architecture.md#cross-cutting-modules]

### Technical Requirements
- Must maintain existing Chrome/Firefox/Safari compatibility
- Should implement dependency injection pattern for testability
- Must not break existing imports during transition period
- Service should be singleton or easily injectable

### Expected Service Interface
```typescript
class BrowserApiService {
  sendMessage(message: any): Promise<any>
  createWindow(options: any): Promise<any>
  getStorage(keys?: string[]): Promise<any>
  setStorage(items: any): Promise<void>
  // ... other browser API methods
}
```

### Migration Strategy
The service will initially coexist with existing platform modules to ensure zero breaking changes. Subsequent stories will migrate calling code to use the service.

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests should be created for the service using Vitest
- Mock browser APIs for testing
- Ensure all existing Playwright tests continue to pass
- Manual browser testing required to verify extension functionality

### Linting Strategy
- When introducing new lint or type checks, add existing files to the ignore list so the baseline continues to pass.
- Whenever you modify one of the ignored files, remove it from the ignore list and resolve any violations so that the updated code complies with the stricter rules.
- Remove this story's touched files from the `.eslintignore` baseline created in Story 1.1 before committing.


### Critical Success Criteria
- Browser API interactions centralized in service
- No functional regression in extension behavior
- Foundation established for making other components testable
- All existing tests continue to pass
