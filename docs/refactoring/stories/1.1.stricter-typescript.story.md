# Story 1.1: Stricter TypeScript Configuration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer maintaining the Sprint Reader extension,
**I want** stricter TypeScript configuration enabled,
**so that** we have stronger type safety baseline before making architectural changes and catch potential issues early.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json` includes stricter checks (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `noUnusedLocals`)
2. All existing type errors revealed by stricter configuration are resolved
3. `npm run typecheck` passes without errors
4. All existing Playwright tests continue to pass

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Modify `tsconfig.json` to enable stricter TypeScript checks (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `noImplicitAny: true`
  - [ ] Add `strictNullChecks: true`
  - [ ] Add `noUnusedLocals: true`
  - [ ] Add other relevant strict flags as appropriate
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` to identify existing type issues (AC: 2)
- [ ] Fix all type errors that arise from stricter configuration (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Address implicit any types
  - [ ] Handle null/undefined checks
  - [ ] Remove unused local variables
- [ ] Verify all tests pass after changes (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Run `npm test` to ensure Playwright tests still pass
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint` to ensure code style compliance

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundation for safe refactoring by implementing stricter TypeScript configuration as outlined in the refactoring plan Phase 0, Step 0.1.

[Source: docs/refactoring/refactoring_plan.md#phase-0-preparation-and-tooling]

### Technical Requirements
- Must maintain all existing functionality during this change
- No behavioral changes should occur - this is purely a developer experience and code quality improvement
- The extension must continue to build and function identically after the changes

### Testing Standards
- All existing Playwright tests must continue to pass
- Use existing test command: `npm test`
- Use existing type checking: `npm run typecheck`
- Use existing linting: `npm run lint`

### Linting Strategy
- When introducing new lint or type checks, add existing files to the ignore list so the baseline continues to pass.
- Whenever you modify one of the ignored files, remove it from the ignore list and resolve any violations so that the updated code complies with the stricter rules.

### Critical Success Criteria
After completion, the codebase must have:
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Zero test failures
- Identical runtime behavior to before the changes
- Stronger type safety foundation for subsequent refactoring phases
