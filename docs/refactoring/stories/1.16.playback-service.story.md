# Story 1.16: Create PlaybackService

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer refactoring the Sprint Reader extension,
**I want** a centralized PlaybackService that manages the timing loop and playback logic,
**so that** playback is decoupled from UI and consistently updates the Zustand store instead of directly manipulating DOM.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `PlaybackService` class is created in `src/reader/playback/playback.service.ts`
2. Service manages the `setTimeout` loop for word advancement
3. When timer fires, service calls store actions to advance `playbackIndex` instead of updating UI directly
4. Service integrates with TimingService for word duration calculations
5. Playback controls (play/pause/restart) work correctly through store actions
6. All playback-related Playwright tests are re-enabled and pass
7. Complete reader functionality is restored with new architecture
8. Unit tests cover PlaybackService core logic (timer scheduling, play/pause/restart, DI), using Vitest with fake timers; untouched legacy code can remain without additional tests

  - [ ] Test complete reader workflow: load text → play → pause → restart
  - [ ] Test WPM changes affect playback speed correctly
  - [ ] Test all user controls work through new architecture
  - [ ] Verify timing accuracy matches previous behavior
- [ ] Final integration and testing
  - [ ] Run full test suite to ensure all tests pass
  - [ ] Test reader functionality manually in browser
  - [ ] Verify performance characteristics are maintained
  - [ ] Run `npm run build:chrome` to verify build integrity
  - [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` to ensure code quality

## Dev Notes
### Linting Strategy
- When introducing new lint or type checks, add existing files to the ignore list so the baseline continues to pass.
- Whenever you modify one of the ignored files, remove it from the ignore list and resolve any violations so that the updated code complies with the stricter rules.
- Remove this story's touched files from the `.eslintignore` baseline created in Story 1.1 before committing.


### Architecture Context
This story implements Phase 5, Step 5.1 of the refactoring plan, creating the final core service that manages playback timing. This completes the service extraction and restores full functionality with the new reactive architecture.

[Source: docs/refactoring/refactoring_plan.md#phase-5-implement-playbackservice-and-finalize-reader]

### Current Playback Architecture
The reader currently manages playback in:
- `src/reader/playback.ts` - Timer management and play/pause logic
- Direct DOM updates from timer callbacks
- State manipulation mixed with UI updates

[Source: docs/architecture.md#reader-ui-modular-architecture]

### PlaybackService Design
```typescript
class PlaybackService {
  private timer: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null

  constructor(
    private timingService: TimingService,
    private store: typeof useReaderStore
  ) {}

  play() {
    const state = this.store.getState()
    if (state.status !== 'playing') {
      this.store.getState().setStatus('playing')
      this.scheduleNextWord()
    }
  }

  pause() {
    this.clearTimer()
    this.store.getState().setStatus('paused')
  }

  private scheduleNextWord() {
    const state = this.store.getState()
    const currentWord = state.words[state.playbackIndex]
    const duration = this.timingService.calculateWordDuration(currentWord, state.wordsPerMinute)

    this.timer = setTimeout(() => {
      this.store.getState().setPlaybackIndex(state.playbackIndex + 1)
      this.scheduleNextWord()
    }, duration)
  }
}
```

### Service Integration Points
The service must integrate with:
- TimingService for word duration calculations
- Zustand store for state management
- Store actions for playback state updates
- Renderer (indirectly through store subscriptions)

### Technical Requirements
- Must not perform any direct DOM manipulation
- Should use TimingService for all timing calculations
- Must handle timer cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Should integrate seamlessly with store-driven UI

### Playback State Management
The service manages:
- Play/pause/stopped states
- Current word index progression
- Timer lifecycle and cleanup
- Integration with user controls

### Performance Requirements
- Timer precision should match existing implementation
- Memory usage should be equivalent or better
- Should handle rapid play/pause interactions gracefully
- Must not cause UI blocking or performance degradation

### Testing Strategy
- Add unit tests for newly created PlaybackService using Vitest fake timers to validate scheduling and state updates. Focus on newly introduced code only.
- Re-enable all playback-related Playwright tests
- Test timer accuracy and progression
- Test play/pause/restart functionality
- Verify integration with speed controls
- Manual testing for timing accuracy

### Store Actions Required
The service will use:
- `setPlaybackIndex(index)` - Advance to next word
- `setStatus(status)` - Update play/pause state
- `setProgress(progress)` - Update progress percentage
- Other actions as needed for complete functionality

### Expected Results
After this story:
- Complete playback functionality restored
- All functionality working through new service architecture
- All tests passing
- Reader fully operational with clean separation of concerns

### Critical Success Criteria
- Playback timing accuracy maintained
- All user controls functional through new architecture
- All tests passing
- Complete reader functionality restored
- Clean service-oriented architecture operational
