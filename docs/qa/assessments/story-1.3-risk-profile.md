# Story 1.3: Directory Structure Creation - Risk Profile Assessment

## Executive Summary
**Risk Level: LOW**
Story 1.3 is a foundational preparation step with minimal technical risk. The story involves only directory creation with no file moves, imports changes, or code modifications, making it extremely safe to execute.

## Risk Analysis

### 1. Technical Risks

#### 1.1 Build System Impact
- **Risk Level**: MINIMAL
- **Description**: Creating empty directories should have zero impact on the existing esbuild pipeline
- **Mitigation**: Verify `npm run build:chrome` continues to work unchanged
- **Detection**: Build failure would be immediately apparent

#### 1.2 Import/Module Resolution
- **Risk Level**: NONE
- **Description**: No files are being moved or imports changed
- **Current Status**: All existing imports remain functional

#### 1.3 Git/Version Control
- **Risk Level**: MINIMAL
- **Description**: Adding empty directories to git is standard operation
- **Mitigation**: Empty directories may not be tracked by git by default

### 2. Functional Risks

#### 2.1 Extension Functionality
- **Risk Level**: NONE
- **Description**: No functional code changes, purely structural preparation
- **Impact**: Zero impact on current RSVP reading, popup, or settings functionality

#### 2.2 Browser Compatibility
- **Risk Level**: NONE
- **Description**: Directory structure changes don't affect runtime behavior
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari all unaffected

### 3. Operational Risks

#### 3.1 Testing Pipeline
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Description**: Playwright tests should continue to pass unchanged
- **Verification Required**: Run full `npm test` suite
- **Expected Outcome**: 22/22 tests passing (current baseline)

#### 3.2 Development Workflow
- **Risk Level**: BENEFICIAL
- **Description**: Creates organized foundation for future refactoring phases
- **Impact**: Improves developer productivity in subsequent stories

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Pre-Implementation
1. Verify current build and test baselines are green
2. Document current directory structure for rollback reference

### During Implementation
1. Create directories incrementally
2. Verify build continues to work after each directory creation
3. Test extension loading manually in browser

### Post-Implementation
1. Run complete verification suite: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build:chrome`, `npm test`
2. Manual smoke test in browser to confirm extension loads and functions

## Rollback Plan
**Complexity: TRIVIAL**
- Simply delete the newly created empty directories
- Git reset/revert if committed
- Zero code changes to undo

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 5 new directories created: `core/`, `reader/playback/`, `reader/state/`, `reader/timing/`, `reader/ui/`
- [ ] Build pipeline unchanged: `npm run build:chrome` succeeds
- [ ] Test suite unchanged: `npm test` passes (22/22)
- [ ] Extension loads normally in browser
- [ ] Zero functional regression

## Dependencies & Blockers
**None identified** - This story has no external dependencies

## Recommendations
1. **PROCEED**: Extremely low risk, high value preparation step
2. Execute immediately after verifying current baseline is green
3. Consider adding `.gitkeep` files to ensure directories are tracked in version control
4. Document completion to enable subsequent Phase 1 stories
