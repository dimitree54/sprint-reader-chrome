# Story 1.3: Directory Structure Creation - Test Design

## Test Strategy Overview
This test design covers validation of Story 1.3's directory structure creation with comprehensive verification that no existing functionality is impacted.

## Test Categories

### 1. Structural Verification Tests

#### 1.1 Directory Creation Verification
- **Objective**: Verify all required directories exist
- **Method**: File system inspection
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] `src/core/` directory exists
  - [ ] `src/reader/playback/` directory exists
  - [ ] `src/reader/state/` directory exists
  - [ ] `src/reader/timing/` directory exists
  - [ ] `src/reader/ui/` directory exists
- **Pass Criteria**: All directories present with proper permissions

#### 1.2 Directory Permissions & Access
- **Objective**: Ensure directories are properly accessible
- **Method**: Write/read test files
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Can create files in each new directory
  - [ ] Can read files from each new directory
  - [ ] No permission errors during build process
- **Pass Criteria**: Standard filesystem permissions applied

### 2. Build System Integration Tests

#### 2.1 Build Pipeline Integrity
- **Objective**: Verify build system continues to function
- **Method**: Execute build commands
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] `npm run build:chrome` executes successfully
  - [ ] `npm run build:firefox` executes successfully
  - [ ] Build output in `dist/` remains unchanged
  - [ ] Bundle sizes remain consistent
- **Pass Criteria**: All builds succeed with no errors or warnings

#### 2.2 Static Asset Processing
- **Objective**: Verify static assets still processed correctly
- **Method**: Build output inspection
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Manifest files generated correctly
  - [ ] CSS files copied properly
  - [ ] Image assets processed normally
- **Pass Criteria**: No missing or corrupted assets

### 3. Code Quality & Standards Tests

#### 3.1 Linting Compliance
- **Objective**: Verify linting rules still apply correctly
- **Method**: Execute linting commands
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] `npm run lint` passes with no new errors
  - [ ] ESLint config recognizes new directories
  - [ ] No unexpected lint rule violations
- **Pass Criteria**: Linting baseline maintained

#### 3.2 Type Checking Integrity
- **Objective**: Verify TypeScript compilation unaffected
- **Method**: Execute TypeScript compiler
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes completely
  - [ ] No new type errors introduced
  - [ ] TypeScript config handles new paths
- **Pass Criteria**: No type compilation errors

### 4. Functional Regression Tests

#### 4.1 Extension Loading Tests
- **Objective**: Verify extension loads normally in browser
- **Method**: Manual browser testing
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Extension loads in Chrome dev mode
  - [ ] Popup interface accessible
  - [ ] Settings page loads
  - [ ] No console errors during load
- **Pass Criteria**: Extension loads without errors

#### 4.2 Core Functionality Tests
- **Objective**: Verify RSVP reading functionality unchanged
- **Method**: End-to-end Playwright suite
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Text selection and reader launch
  - [ ] RSVP playback functionality
  - [ ] Speed controls and settings
  - [ ] Theme switching
  - [ ] OpenAI integration (if configured)
- **Pass Criteria**: All existing Playwright tests pass (22/22)

### 5. Performance & Resource Tests

#### 5.1 Build Performance
- **Objective**: Verify build times not impacted
- **Method**: Build time measurement
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Build time within expected range
  - [ ] No memory issues during build
  - [ ] Bundle sizes consistent
- **Pass Criteria**: Build performance baseline maintained

#### 5.2 Runtime Performance
- **Objective**: Verify extension performance unchanged
- **Method**: Performance monitoring
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Extension startup time unchanged
  - [ ] Memory usage baseline maintained
  - [ ] Reader load time under 700ms (target)
- **Pass Criteria**: Performance targets met

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Baseline
1. Record current build success state
2. Record current test passing state (22/22)
3. Record current performance metrics
4. Document current directory structure

### Phase 2: Implementation Validation
1. Verify each directory creation individually
2. Test build system after each directory added
3. Verify no import resolution issues

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Regression Testing
1. Execute full build pipeline: `npm run build:chrome`
2. Execute complete linting: `npm run lint`
3. Execute type checking: `npm run typecheck`
4. Execute full test suite: `npm test`
5. Manual browser loading verification

### Phase 4: Performance Validation
1. Measure build times
2. Verify bundle sizes
3. Test extension loading performance
4. Monitor resource usage

## Test Environment Requirements

### Development Environment
- Node.js environment with npm
- Chrome browser for extension testing
- Access to OpenAI API key (for integration tests)
- Git repository with clean working directory

### Browser Testing
- Chrome (primary target)
- Extension developer mode enabled
- Clean browser profile for testing

## Pass/Fail Criteria

### PASS Conditions
- All 5 directories created successfully
- Build commands complete without errors
- All Playwright tests pass (22/22)
- Extension loads normally in browser
- No performance regression detected
- Linting and type checking clean

### FAIL Conditions
- Any directory creation fails
- Build process breaks or produces errors
- Any Playwright test fails
- Extension fails to load in browser
- Significant performance degradation
- New linting or type errors introduced

## Test Data Requirements
- **No specific test data needed** - this is purely structural
- Existing test fixtures and data remain unchanged
- OpenAI API key required only for existing integration tests

## Automation & CI Integration
- All validation commands can be automated via npm scripts
- Playwright tests provide automated regression coverage
- Build verification automated through existing scripts
- Performance monitoring can be scripted if needed

## Risk Coverage Matrix

| Risk Category | Test Coverage | Validation Method |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Build System | High | Build command execution |
| Import Resolution | High | Type checking + build |
| Functional Regression | High | Playwright test suite |
| Performance Impact | Medium | Build time + load testing |
| Git/VCS Issues | Low | Standard git operations |

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: 100% existing test suite passes
- **Secondary**: Build completes in under 30 seconds
- **Tertiary**: Extension loads in under 2 seconds
