# Agents rules

Before start working with the repo, read fully `docs/architecture.md`

When working on task - make minimal modification to achieve the task. Avoid modifying not-related files.

Avoid fallbacks and default behaviours in case of problems - really try to fix problem instead of hiding it. If can not fix - report to user before making workarounds.

Do not keep any legacy code - everything should be up-to-date. Remove all not needed code.

After implementing signinficant changes, make sure to update README.md and docs/*.md - they should always stay up-to-date
