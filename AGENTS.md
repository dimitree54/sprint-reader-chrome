# Agents rules

Before start working with the repo, read fully `docs/architecture.md`

When working on task - make minimal modification to achieve the task. Avoid modifying not-related files.

Avoid fallbacks and default behaviours in case of problems - really try to fix problem instead of hiding it. If can not fix - report to user before making workarounds.
